Gladier provides a simple software interface to enable researchers to rapidly create, manage, and deploy complex automation flows. It has been used as a programmable data capture, storage, and analysis architecture at experimental facilities including the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility and the Advanced Photon Source. Gladier makes it easy to connect heterogeneous data and computing substrates deployed across distributed compute and storage 
systems and manage using Globus Flows.

Whether you're working in materials science, X-ray science, automated laboratores, genomics, or any other research field, 
Gladier can help you streamline your data management and analysis workflows, so you can focus on your scientific discoveries.
Try Gladier today and see how it can enhance your research capabilities!



Installation
============

Gladier requires Python 3.6 and higher. For a modern version of python,
see the official `Python Installation Guide <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/>`_.

The easiest way to get Gladier is through Pip on PyPi. Gladier is built with two
main packages, the core Gladier client and Gladier Tools. Gladier Tools include
a set of reusable, common operations. Installing it is highly recommended.

With pip installed, you can do the following:


.. code-block:: bash

   pip install gladier gladier-tools

See the `Read-The-Docs <https://gladier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable>`_ getting started.
