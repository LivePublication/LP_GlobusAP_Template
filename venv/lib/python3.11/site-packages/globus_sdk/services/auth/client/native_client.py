    This type of ``AuthClient`` is used to represent a Native App's
    communications with Globus Auth.

    Native Apps are applications, like the Globus CLI, which are run
    client-side and therefore cannot keep secrets. Unable to possess client
    credentials, several Globus Auth interactions have to be specialized to
    accommodate the absence of a secret.

    Any keyword arguments given are passed through to the ``AuthClient``
