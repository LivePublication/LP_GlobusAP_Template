class IdentityMap:
    r"""
    There's a common pattern of having a large batch of Globus Auth Identities which you
    want to inspect. For example, you may have a list of identity IDs fetched from
    Access Control Lists on Globus Endpoints. In order to display these identities to an
    end user, you may want to resolve them to usernames.

    However, naively looking up the identities one-by-one is very inefficient. It's best
    to do batched lookups with multiple identities at once. In these cases, an
    ``IdentityMap`` can be used to do those batched lookups for you.

    An ``IdentityMap`` is a mapping-like type which converts Identity IDs and Identity
    Names to Identity records (dictionaries) using the Globus Auth API.

    .. note::

        ``IdentityMap`` objects are not full Mappings in the same sense as python dicts
        and similar objects. By design, they only implement a small part of the Mapping
        protocol.

    The basic usage pattern is

    - create an ``IdentityMap`` with an AuthClient which will be used to call out to
      Globus Auth

    - seed the ``IdentityMap`` with IDs and Usernames via :py:meth:`~IdentityMap.add` (you
      can also do this during initialization)

    - retrieve identity IDs or Usernames from the map

    Because the map can be populated with a collection of identity IDs and Usernames
    prior to lookups being performed, it can improve the efficiency of these operations
    up to 100x over individual lookups.

    If you attempt to retrieve an identity which has not been previously added to the
    map, it will be immediately added. But adding many identities beforehand will
    improve performance.

    The ``IdentityMap`` will cache its results so that repeated lookups of the same Identity
    will not repeat work. It will also map identities both by ID and by Username,
    regardless of how they're initially looked up.

    .. warning::

        If an Identity is not found in Globus Auth, it will trigger a KeyError when
        looked up. Your code must be ready to handle KeyErrors when doing a lookup.

    Correct usage looks something like so::

        ac = globus_sdk.AuthClient(...)
        idmap = globus_sdk.IdentityMap(
            ac, ["foo@globusid.org", "bar@uchicago.edu"]
        )
        idmap.add("baz@xsede.org")
        # adding by ID is also valid
        idmap.add("c699d42e-d274-11e5-bf75-1fc5bf53bb24")
        # map ID to username
        assert (
            idmap["c699d42e-d274-11e5-bf75-1fc5bf53bb24"]["username"]
            == "go@globusid.org"
        )
        # map username to ID
        assert (
            idmap["go@globusid.org"]["id"]
            == "c699d42e-d274-11e5-bf75-1fc5bf53bb24"
        )

    And simple handling of errors::

        try:
            record = idmap["no-such-valid-id@example.org"]
        except KeyError:
            username = "NO_SUCH_IDENTITY"
        else:
            username = record["username"]

    or you may achieve this by using the :py:meth:`~.IdentityMap.get` method::

        # internally handles the KeyError and returns the default value
        record = idmap.get("no-such-valid-id@example.org", None)
        username = record["username"] if record is not None else "NO_SUCH_IDENTITY"
